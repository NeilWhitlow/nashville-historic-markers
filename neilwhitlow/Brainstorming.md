###MainActivity###

* #### Cache Data In Json Format ####



###MarkerActivity (detail page)###

* #### Photo ####
Given that the public data store does not include a photo, is it possible to use the coordinates to retrieve the Google streetview in the proper orientation reliably to present a view of where the Marker is at?


* #### Maps ####
On MarkerActivity provide a tab for display of Google Map with a Marker denoting the Marker :)
